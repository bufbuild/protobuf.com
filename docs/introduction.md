Welcome to the Protobuf Guide. In the long term, the goal for this site
is to be your one-stop-shop for all things Protocol Buffers. Expect to see reference guides,
best practices, common patterns and recipes, how-tos, and deep
dives into various topics (custom code generation with plugins, the well-known types, and more).
We'll include some bits about the history of Protocol Buffers and Protobuf-based RPC as well.

Today, the content of the site begins with the most foundational of reference information for a language:
its specification. This content aims to accurately describe all elements of the Protobuf language and
the expected behavior of a Protobuf compiler.
This [language specification](language-spec.md) is the only accurate and complete language specification for Protobuf,
and it is meant to help foster a stronger Protobuf ecosystem. We hope this aids the community of Protobuf
users, as well as other toolmakers.
